          Hi, I'm Connor Olson! I am a new developer taking a comprehensive, full-time, full-stack development class at University of Washington. I’m from the Seattle area but have a degree in Information Management and Technology from Syracuse University. I have experience working with networking technology like Aruba when I worked for a systems integrator. I also completed a rigorous, yearlong program at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in Alpahretta, Georgia. I received trainings on all HPE technology, from hardware like Aruba, Simplivity, and Synergy, to software like OneView and VMware. I needed to get out of the office, so a few years ago I tried building custom closets, and was then an apprentice carpenter. I loved working with my hands and building things, but the hard work taught me to appreciate technology jobs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I can’t wait to apply my passion for building things to a new job involving coding. Some of my other passions include music,  lacrosse, and skiing. I currently coach for Inglemoor youth lacrosse and play in men’s leagues. I’m considering getting back into ski racing with masters but love going to the mountain with my friends. I’ve also taken steps to learn to produce music and DJ. I’ve always loved technology and electronics, and look forward to continuing my career in IT.
